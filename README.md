- Hello, I’m Josephine Cudjoe.
- As a rising Bioinformatician and Data Scientist, I am interested in leveraging data to drive strategic decisions especially in the health sector. I am also keen on leveraging biological data to accelerate the discovery of highly potent antimalarial drugs.
- With expertise in Power BI, Advanced Excel, SQL and Python, I have implemented data analytics and machine learning to work on several projects including a machine learning project on cancer drug discovery.
- I look forward to connecting with professionals who share the same aspirations and also working as a Data Analyst in a company that believes in the power of Data.
- You can get in touch with me via this email address; cudjoejosephen45@gmail.com.
